# CFC's Logging Library (BETA)



## Installation
Simply download a copy of the zip, or clone the repository straight into your addons folder! (When we finalize the API, we won't release breaking changes to master)


## Usage
CFCLogger lets you create and configure your own logging object to be used in your project.

Barebones usage example:
```lua
local logger = CFCLogger( "MyProjectName" )

logger:trace( "This is an trace message!" )
logger:debug( "This is an debug message!" )
logger:info( "This is an info message!" )
logger:warn( "This is an warn message!" )
logger:error( "This is an error message!" )
logger:fatal( "This is an fatal message!" )
```

Which produces this output:
```
[MyProjectName] [info] This is an info message!
[MyProjectName] [warn] This is an warn message!
[MyProjectName] [error] This is an error message!
[MyProjectName] [fatal] This is an fatal message!
```

## Logging Levels
When a logger is created, one may pass an optional second parameter which defines the current log level of the app.
By default it's set to `"info"` which means everything but `debug` and `trace` messages are printed. (`trace < debug < info < warn < error < fatal`)

Any message sent with a lower log-level than the one defined in the logger object will not be printed.

As an example, if you set the default log level to `"error"`, then only `"error"` and `"fatal"` messages are printed.
```lua
local logger = CFCLogger( "MyProjectName", "error" )

logger:trace( "This is an trace message!" )
logger:debug( "This is an debug message!" )
logger:info( "This is an info message!" )
logger:warn( "This is an warn message!" )
logger:error( "This is an error message!" )
logger:fatal( "This is an fatal message!" )
```

Output:
```
[MyProjectName] [error] This is an error message!
[MyProjectName] [fatal] This is an fatal message!
```

## Callbacks
The logger object allows you to add callbacks to any log-level.
If a message comes through with the matching log level, the callback is called.

The callback is provided with one parameter; the contents of the message to be printed (before adding the prefixes like `"[MyProject]"`).

For example, maybe you want to forward all `fatal` messages to Discord.

The syntax for adding callbacks is as follows:
```lua
MyLoggingInstance:on( logLevel ):call( myCallback )
```

In an example:
```lua
local function forwardFatalToDiscord( message )
    -- send the message to discord
    print( "Sending fatal message to discord! ( " .. message .. ")" )
end

local logger = CFCLogger( "MyProjectName" )
logger:on( "fatal" ):call( forwardFatalToDiscord )

logger:fatal( "Major oof!" )
```

Output:
```
[MyProjectName] [fatal] Major oof!
Sending fatal message to discord! ( Major oof!)
```

**Please note that the callbacks will run _regardless of the default log level setting_**.

This means that if your log level is set to `"error"`, but you add a callback to `"warn"`, all `"warn"` messages would not be printed in the console, but the attached callback _would_ fire.

As an example:
```lua
local logger = CFCLogger( "MyProject", "fatal" )
logger:on( "warn" ):call(function(message) print("I'm a 'warn' callback!") end)

logger:warn("This is a test!")
```
Would only output:
```
I'm a 'warn' callback!
```

## Global Override
The log level for every newly-created Logger can be overridden by writing a log level (e.g. `debug`) to the config file `data/cfc/logger/forced_log_level.txt`
